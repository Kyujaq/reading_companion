# Future Ideas

High-value opportunities for the next development run:

1. **Progress persistence** — Save session logs to `localStorage` so parents/teachers can review a child's history over time. Show a simple "streak" or star reward system.

2. **Custom lesson builder** — A drag-and-drop UI for teachers/parents to create their own lesson scripts (JSON editor with preview).

3. **Spaced repetition** — Track which letters/words the child struggles with and surface them more frequently in future sessions.

4. **Letta agent integration** — Replace the stateless Ollama calls with a Letta persistent agent that remembers the child's progress across sessions and adapts its teaching style.

5. **Printable worksheets** — Generate a PDF or printable HTML of the day's lesson (words practiced, letters learned).

6. **Multiplayer/co-op mode** — Two children on the same device, taking turns, with cooperative syllable-building.

7. **SVG clipart assets** — Commission or source a proper open-license SVG clipart set to replace emoji in the gallery, with labeled vector regions for body parts etc.

8. **Pre-segmented scene images** — Illustrated "kitchen", "classroom", "playground" scenes with clickable named regions.

9. **Phoneme-level Vosk models** — Use Vosk's phoneme recognition mode to detect whether a child said the *sound* of a letter (e.g., /v/ phoneme) vs. the *name* (e.g., "vé"), enabling finer-grained phonics assessment.

10. **Mobile app wrapper** — Package as a Capacitor or PWA app for offline tablet use without needing a browser.
